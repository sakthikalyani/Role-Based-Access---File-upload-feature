## Project Overview

**Domain:** FinTech  
**Function:** AI Engineering  

FinSolve Technologies is a leading FinTech company offering innovative financial services to individuals and enterprises. However, communication delays and siloed data across departments (Finance, Marketing, HR, Engineering, and C-Level) have caused major bottlenecks in decision-making and project execution.

To tackle this, a digital transformation initiative was launched to build **FinsightAI** â€” a secure, role-aware AI chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The assistant helps teams access accurate, department-specific insights instantly and securely.
